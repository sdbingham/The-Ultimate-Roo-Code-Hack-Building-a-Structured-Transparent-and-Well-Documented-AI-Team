# Project Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented for the Roo Framework project, addressing Docker configuration, Memory MCP Adapter, and Memory mode transition issues.

## 1. Docker Configuration Fixes

### Issue
The Docker configuration was using standard ports that could conflict with other applications running on the same machine.

### Solution
Updated the Docker configuration to use non-standard ports:

| Service | Original Port | New Port |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Weaviate | 8081 | 9081 |
| Neo4j UI | 7475 | 9475 |
| Neo4j Bolt | 7688 | 9687 |
| MongoDB | 27018 | 29017 |
| Chroma | 8001 | 9001 |

### Files Modified
- `docker-compose.yml` - Updated port mappings
- Environment variable templates - Updated port references

## 2. Memory MCP Adapter Fixes

### Issue
The Memory MCP Adapter was not properly handling service failures and had issues with the Weaviate client API.

### Solution
Enhanced the Memory MCP Adapter with:
- Support for different versions of the Weaviate client API
- Error handling for Chroma operations
- MongoDB text index for better search functionality
- Fallback mechanisms for service failures

### Files Modified
- `roo-framework-package/lib/memory-mcp-adapter.js` - Updated port references and added error handling

## 3. Memory Mode Transition Fix

### Issue
Memory mode was not transitioning back to other modes when it completed its task, causing workflow disruptions.

### Root Cause
The Memory mode's custom instructions in the `.roomodes` file were missing the Mode Transition Protocol section that is present in other modes' instructions.

### Solution
Created a patch to update the Memory mode's custom instructions to include the Mode Transition Protocol section, ensuring that Memory mode properly transitions back to the originating mode after completing its task.

### Files Modified
- `.roomodes` - Added Mode Transition Protocol section to Memory mode's custom instructions

## 4. Testing and Verification

### Test Scripts
Created test scripts to verify the functionality of the Memory MCP Adapter:
- `test-roo-memory.js` - Tests basic memory operations
- `test-roo-memory-relationships.js` - Tests memory relationships

### Documentation
Created documentation to explain the changes and how to test them:
- `testing-roo-framework-memory.md` - Instructions for testing the Memory MCP Adapter
- `docker-memory-mcp-changes.md` - Details of Docker configuration and Memory MCP Adapter changes
- `memory-mode-transition-fix.md` - Explanation of the Memory mode transition issue and solution
- `memory-mode-transition-fix-patch.md` - Patch for fixing the Memory mode transition issue

## Conclusion

These fixes ensure that:
1. The Docker configuration uses non-standard ports to avoid conflicts with other applications
2. The Memory MCP Adapter is resilient to service failures and API changes
3. Memory mode properly transitions back to other modes when it completes its task

Together, these changes improve the overall stability, reliability, and user experience of the Roo Framework.
