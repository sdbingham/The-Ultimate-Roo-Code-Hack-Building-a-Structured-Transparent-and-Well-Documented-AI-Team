## How the Team Works Together

The Roo AI team follows the "Boomerang Pattern" for seamless collaboration:

1. **Orchestrator** breaks down your request into specific tasks
2. **Orchestrator** assigns each task to the appropriate specialist
3. **Specialists** complete their assigned tasks
4. **Specialists** return their work to Orchestrator
5. **Orchestrator** integrates all the pieces and delivers the final result

This structured workflow ensures efficient use of resources, clear accountability, and high-quality deliverables for all your projects.
