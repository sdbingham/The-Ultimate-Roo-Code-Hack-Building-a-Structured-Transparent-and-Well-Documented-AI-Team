# Roo Framework Project Cleanup

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup and reorganization of the Roo Framework project to improve maintainability, reduce redundancy, and ensure version consistency.

## Changes Made

### 1. Version Consistency

- Updated all version references to 4.5.1 across the project:
  - Main project `package.json`: 4.3.0 → 4.5.1
  - `roo-framework-package/package.json`: 4.5.0 → 4.5.1
  - `roo-framework-package/index.js`: 4.5.0 → 4.5.1
  - Updated CHANGELOG.md with 4.5.1 release notes

### 2. Dependency Management

- Made LangChain dependencies required instead of optional:
  - Moved LangChain packages from peer dependencies to regular dependencies
  - Updated `quick-setup.js` to always install LangChain dependencies
  - Updated documentation to reflect that LangChain is now a core component

### 3. Environment Configuration Simplification

- Created a single, comprehensive `.env` file:
  - Combined Docker and LangChain configuration in one file
  - Added clear placeholders and documentation
  - Eliminated the need for environment variable generation scripts
  - Simplified the setup process for users

### 4. Script Improvements

- Enhanced `setup.js` with non-interactive mode:
  - Added command-line flags for automation
  - Enabled Docker container startup in non-interactive mode
  - Enabled LangChain setup in non-interactive mode
  - Improved error handling for both interactive and non-interactive modes

### 5. Script Consolidation

- Consolidated functionality from multiple scripts into a single `quick-setup.js` script:
  - Incorporated `add-langchain-scripts.js` functionality
  - Incorporated `install-langchain-deps.js` functionality
  - Eliminated dependencies on external scripts
  - Streamlined the setup process by using the non-interactive mode of `setup.js`

### 3. Documentation Consolidation

- Created core documentation files:
  - `README.md`: Main project documentation with quick start guide
  - `INSTALLATION.md`: Comprehensive installation instructions
  - `CHANGELOG.md`: Version history and changes
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md`: System architecture and design

### 4. Project Organization

- Created `project-organization.md` to document the project structure and identify redundancies
- Identified files that can be removed to reduce clutter

## Using the Consolidated Setup Script

The `quick-setup.js` script now handles the entire setup process in a single command:

```bash
node quick-setup.js
```

This script performs the following actions:

1. Installs LangChain dependencies with correct versions
2. Adds necessary scripts to package.json
3. Updates the project version to 4.5.1
4. Configures environment variables
5. Runs the framework setup
6. Sets up LangChain integration
7. Tests the integration

## Files to Keep

- **Core Documentation**:
  - `README.md`
  - `INSTALLATION.md`
  - `CHANGELOG.md`
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `PROJECT-CLEANUP.md`

- **Core Scripts**:
  - `quick-setup.js`
  - `setup-roo-framework.js`

- **Reference Documentation** (for technical details):
  - `docker-architecture-documentation.md`
  - `langchain-integration-setup-guide.md`
  - `environment-configuration-guide.md`

## Files to Remove

The following files are now redundant and can be safely removed:

- **Scripts**:
  - `add-langchain-scripts.js` (functionality moved to quick-setup.js)
  - `install-langchain-deps.js` (functionality moved to quick-setup.js)
  - `generate-readme.js` (no longer needed)
  - `create-env-file.js` (replaced by direct .env file)
  - `env-template.js` (replaced by direct .env file)
  - `roo-framework-package/scripts/generate-env-example.js` (replaced by direct .env file)
  - `roo-framework-package/scripts/generate-env-template.js` (replaced by direct .env file)
  - `roo-framework-package/scripts/setup-langchain-env.js` (functionality incorporated into setup.js)

- **Documentation**:
  - `roo-framework-documentation-index.md` (consolidated into README.md)
  - `installation-troubleshooting-guide.md` (consolidated into INSTALLATION.md)
  - `package-json-update-guide.md` (consolidated into INSTALLATION.md)
  - `env-file-update-guide.md` (consolidated into INSTALLATION.md)
  - `setup-script-enhancement.md` (implemented in quick-setup.js)
  - `version-consistency-plan.md` (implemented)
  - `documentation-consolidation-plan.md` (implemented)
  - `project-fixes-summary.md` (superseded by PROJECT-CLEANUP.md)

## Next Steps

1. Run the consolidated setup script:
   ```bash
   node quick-setup.js
   ```

2. Remove redundant files to clean up the project
   
3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   npm run test-langchain
   npm run docker:health
   ```

4. Try the LangChain example:
   ```bash
   npm run langchain-example
   ```

The project now has a cleaner structure, consistent version numbers, and a streamlined setup process.
