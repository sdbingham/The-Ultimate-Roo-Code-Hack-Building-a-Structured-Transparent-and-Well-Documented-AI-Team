# Roo Framework Docker Architecture Enhancement Plan

## Current Architecture Overview

The Roo Framework currently uses Docker to provide four essential database services:

1. **Weaviate** (Port 8081): Vector database for semantic search
2. **Neo4j** (Ports 7475/7688): Graph database for relationship management
3. **MongoDB** (Port 27018): Document database for structured data storage
4. **Chroma** (Port 8001): Vector database for embeddings

These services are defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file and managed through setup and health check scripts.

## Identified Improvement Opportunities

After analyzing the current Docker configuration, I've identified several opportunities to enhance the architecture:

### 1. Network Isolation

**Current State**: Containers use the default bridge network, which may expose them to other containers on the host.

**Recommendation**: Create a dedicated network for Roo Framework containers to improve isolation and security.

```yaml
# To be implemented in Code mode
networks:
  roo_network:
    driver: bridge
```

### 2. Container Naming

**Current State**: Containers use auto-generated names based on the directory and service name.

**Recommendation**: Explicitly name containers for easier reference in commands and logs.

```yaml
# To be implemented in Code mode
services:
  weaviate:
    container_name: roo_weaviate
    # other configuration...
```

### 3. Restart Policy

**Current State**: No restart policy defined, meaning containers won't automatically restart after crashes.

**Recommendation**: Add restart policies to ensure service continuity.

```yaml
# To be implemented in Code mode
services:
  weaviate:
    restart: unless-stopped
    # other configuration...
```

### 4. Environment Variables File

**Current State**: Environment variables are defined inline or use default values.

**Recommendation**: Create a `.env.example` file and document all configurable parameters.

```
# Example .env file content
WEAVIATE_MEMORY_LIMIT=2G
WEAVIATE_CPU_LIMIT=1
NEO4J_MEMORY_PAGECACHE=512M
NEO4J_MEMORY_HEAP_INITIAL=512M
NEO4J_MEMORY_HEAP_MAX=1G
NEO4J_MEMORY_LIMIT=2G
NEO4J_CPU_LIMIT=1
MONGODB_MEMORY_LIMIT=1G
MONGODB_CPU_LIMIT=1
CHROMA_MEMORY_LIMIT=1G
CHROMA_CPU_LIMIT=1
ROO_CHROMA_AUTH_TOKEN=admin_token
```

### 5. Docker Compose Version

**Current State**: No version specified in docker-compose.yml.

**Recommendation**: Add version specification for compatibility.

```yaml
# To be implemented in Code mode
version: '3.8'
```

### 6. Health Check Enhancements

**Current State**: Basic health checks implemented but could be more robust.

**Recommendation**: Enhance health checks with more detailed diagnostics and recovery procedures.

### 7. Documentation

**Current State**: Limited documentation on Docker configuration and troubleshooting.

**Recommendation**: Create comprehensive documentation on Docker setup, configuration, and troubleshooting.

## Implementation Plan

To implement these improvements, we should:

1. Create a new branch for Docker enhancements
2. Update docker-compose.yml with network isolation, container naming, restart policies, and version
3. Create a .env.example file with documented environment variables
4. Enhance the docker-health-check.js script
5. Update documentation with Docker configuration details
6. Test the changes in a clean environment
7. Merge the changes to the main branch

## Migration Strategy

For existing users, we should provide a migration guide:

1. Backup existing data volumes
2. Pull the latest changes
3. Update environment variables if needed
4. Restart containers with the new configuration

## Security Considerations

The enhanced Docker configuration improves security through:

1. Network isolation to prevent unauthorized access
2. Explicit environment variables for credentials
3. Resource limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks

## Performance Considerations

The configuration includes resource limits that can be adjusted based on available hardware:

1. Memory limits for each container
2. CPU limits for each container
3. Cache size configuration for databases

## Monitoring and Maintenance

For ongoing monitoring and maintenance:

1. Use the enhanced docker-health-check.js script regularly
2. Monitor container logs for errors
3. Update container images periodically for security patches

## Conclusion

These architectural enhancements will significantly improve the robustness, security, and usability of the Roo Framework Docker configuration. The implementation should be done in Code mode, following the recommendations outlined in this document.
