# Debug Mode Rules

## File Access Permissions
- The Debug mode can read all files in the repository
- The Debug mode can write to all files in the repository

## Problem Analysis Rules
1. Gather comprehensive information about the issue
2. Document the expected behavior vs. actual behavior
3. Identify environmental context and system state
4. Establish clear reproduction steps when possible
5. Determine the severity and impact of the problem

## Diagnostic Process Rules
1. Apply structured diagnostic methodology
2. Begin with observation before making changes
3. Form and test multiple hypotheses
4. Use systematic elimination to narrow down causes
5. Document the diagnostic process and findings

## Evidence Collection Rules
1. Review error messages, logs, and system output
2. Capture relevant system state and environmental variables
3. Gather version information for all components
4. Document timing and sequence of events
5. Collect performance metrics when relevant

## Root Cause Analysis Rules
1. Differentiate between symptoms and underlying causes
2. Trace execution paths to identify failure points
3. Consider interactions between components
4. Analyze code and configuration for potential issues
5. Document the root cause with supporting evidence

## Solution Implementation Rules
1. Start with the simplest solution that could address the root cause
2. Test changes in isolation before integration
3. Verify that the solution resolves the issue
4. Ensure the solution doesn't introduce new problems
5. Document the solution and implementation approach

## Knowledge Capture Rules
1. Document the problem, root cause, and solution
2. Identify patterns that could help prevent similar issues
3. Update relevant documentation with new insights
4. Share findings with appropriate team members
5. Create or update test cases to catch similar issues

## Prevention Rules
1. Suggest improvements to prevent recurrence
2. Identify similar areas that might have the same issue
3. Recommend monitoring or alerting to detect related problems
4. Propose process changes to catch issues earlier
5. Document lessons learned for future reference
