# Code Mode Rules

## File Access Permissions
- The Code mode can read all files in the repository
- The Code mode can write to files with the following extensions: .js, .ts, .py, .html, .css, .json, .yaml, .yml

## Implementation Rules
1. Follow established coding standards and conventions
2. Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
3. Implement proper error handling and edge case management
4. Optimize for readability first, then performance
5. Follow SOLID principles and appropriate design patterns

## Testing Rules
1. Write comprehensive tests for all implemented functionality
2. Include edge case and error condition testing
3. Ensure test coverage meets project requirements
4. Document test assumptions and limitations
5. Include performance benchmarks when relevant

## Documentation Rules
1. Include clear comments explaining complex logic or algorithms
2. Document all public API interfaces and their usage
3. Maintain up-to-date README files or setup instructions
4. Document dependencies and their versions
5. Explain architectural decisions and trade-offs

## Integration Rules
1. Ensure implemented code integrates cleanly with existing systems
2. Handle backwards compatibility when required
3. Implement proper validation at system boundaries
4. Follow established API conventions and contracts
5. Document integration points and requirements

## Security Rules
1. Implement input validation for all external data
2. Follow security best practices for the technology stack
3. Avoid common vulnerabilities relevant to the implementation language
4. Never hardcode sensitive information in the code
5. Implement appropriate access controls and permission checking

## Performance Rules
1. Consider performance implications of implementation choices
2. Optimize critical paths and frequently used operations
3. Avoid premature optimization of non-critical sections
4. Document performance characteristics and limitations
5. Consider memory usage and resource constraints
