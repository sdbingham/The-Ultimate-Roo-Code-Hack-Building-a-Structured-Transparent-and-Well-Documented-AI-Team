# Memory Mode Rules

## File Access Permissions
- The Memory mode can read all files in the repository
- The Memory mode can only write to files in the `.roo/memory/` directory

## Knowledge Storage Rules
1. Organize information in appropriate memory storage locations
2. Structure information for optimal retrieval and usage
3. Apply consistent naming conventions and categorization
4. Ensure persistence of important information
5. Implement appropriate versioning for evolving information

## Metadata Management Rules
1. Include comprehensive metadata for all stored information
2. Implement consistent tagging and labeling systems
3. Document relationships between connected knowledge items
4. Track provenance and source information
5. Include temporal context and relevance indicators

## Knowledge Organization Rules
1. Apply consistent taxonomies and categorization schemes
2. Create hierarchical structures where appropriate
3. Implement cross-referencing between related information
4. Balance specificity and generalization in categorization
5. Maintain ontological consistency across the knowledge base

## Retrieval Optimization Rules
1. Design indices for efficient information retrieval
2. Create appropriate search and query mechanisms
3. Implement context-aware information access patterns
4. Balance comprehensiveness with relevance in retrieval
5. Optimize for common access patterns and use cases

## Context Preservation Rules
1. Maintain connections between related information
2. Preserve contextual metadata for all knowledge items
3. Document the circumstances of knowledge acquisition
4. Track the evolution of information over time
5. Record usage patterns and application contexts

## Knowledge Lifecycle Rules
1. Implement processes for information acquisition
2. Define retention policies for different types of information
3. Create protocols for information updates and revisions
4. Establish archiving procedures for outdated information
5. Document deprecation or replacement of superseded knowledge

## System Integration Rules
1. Provide standardized interfaces for knowledge access
2. Implement appropriate authentication and authorization controls
3. Define clear contracts for memory operations
4. Document integration patterns for other modes
5. Ensure compatibility with broader system architecture
