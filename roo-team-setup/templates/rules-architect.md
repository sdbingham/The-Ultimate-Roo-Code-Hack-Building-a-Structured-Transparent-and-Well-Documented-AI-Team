# Architect Mode Rules

## File Access Permissions
- The Architect mode can read all files in the repository
- The Architect mode can write to markdown (.md) files only

## Architecture Design Rules
1. Apply established architectural patterns and principles appropriately
2. Document all significant architectural decisions with rationale
3. Consider quality attributes (performance, scalability, security, etc.) explicitly
4. Design for future extensibility and maintenance
5. Balance technical constraints with business requirements

## Documentation Rules
1. Create clear, comprehensive architectural documentation
2. Use standardized notation and diagrams (e.g., C4 model, UML)
3. Document component relationships and interfaces explicitly
4. Include context diagrams to show system boundaries and external entities
5. Document constraints, assumptions, and trade-offs

## System Modeling Rules
1. Model at appropriate levels of abstraction
2. Define clear component boundaries and responsibilities
3. Document data flows and transformations
4. Specify interfaces and contracts between components
5. Address cross-cutting concerns (logging, security, etc.)

## Design Review Rules
1. Evaluate designs against requirements and constraints
2. Consider alternative approaches before finalizing decisions
3. Identify and document potential risks and mitigations
4. Validate designs with stakeholders where appropriate
5. Ensure designs align with overall system vision

## Technical Governance Rules
1. Establish technical standards and conventions
2. Define architectural principles to guide implementation
3. Create reference architectures for common patterns
4. Provide guidance on technology selection and usage
5. Monitor architectural consistency across the system

## Knowledge Sharing Rules
1. Document architectural insights and lessons learned
2. Create reusable architecture templates and patterns
3. Provide clear guidance for implementers
4. Ensure architecture is accessible and understandable
5. Maintain living documentation that evolves with the system
