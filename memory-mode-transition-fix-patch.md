# Memory Mode Transition Fix - Patch

This document contains the patch that should be applied to the `.roomodes` file to fix the Memory mode transition issue.

## Patch Details

The patch updates the Memory mode's custom instructions to include the Mode Transition Protocol section, which will ensure that Memory mode properly transitions back to the originating mode after completing its task.

Knowledge assets created or updated\n2. Categorization and indexing applied\n3. Relationships established with existing knowledge\n4. Retrieval patterns for accessing the knowledge\n5. Recommendations for knowledge application\n\n### Transition Command Format\n```\n<switch_mode>\n<mode_slug>originating_mode</mode_slug>\n<reason>Knowledge preservation is complete. Returning to continue the main task.</reason>\n</switch_mode>\n```\n\n### Boomerang Implementation\n- Always record the originating mode when receiving a task\n- After completing knowledge preservation tasks, automatically transition back to the originating mode\n- Use the following pattern to implement the boomerang return:\n  1. Verify task completion with the pre-transition checklist\n  2. Document the knowledge assets created or updated\n  3. Use the switch_mode command to return to the originating mode\n  4. Include a clear reason for the transition"

## Application Instructions

To apply this patch:

1. Open the `.roomodes` file in a text editor.
2. Locate the Memory mode section (around line 69).
3. Replace the existing `customInstructions` value with the updated value from the patch.
4. Save the file.

Alternatively, you can use the following steps to manually update the file:

1. Open the `.roomodes` file in a text editor.
2. Locate the Memory mode section (around line 69).
3. Find the `customInstructions` field for the Memory mode.
4. Add the Mode Transition Protocol section after the Organization & Indexing section.
5. Save the file.

## Verification

After applying the patch, verify that Memory mode correctly transitions back to the originating mode by:

1. Starting in Orchestrator mode
2. Transitioning to Memory mode for a knowledge preservation task
3. Completing the task in Memory mode
4. Confirming that the system automatically transitions back to Orchestrator mode

This patch ensures that Memory mode properly follows the boomerang pattern, transitioning back to the originating mode after completing its task, which will improve the overall workflow and user experience.
