# Roo Framework Implementation Guide

This practical guide provides concrete implementation steps and examples for fully utilizing the Roo Framework capabilities, addressing the key issues identified in the architectural analysis.

## 1. Implementing Effective Mode Switching

### Configuration: Mode Transition Triggers

Add these transition triggers to your project's custom instructions:

```markdown
## Mode Transition Protocol

### Transition Triggers
- Code â†’ Architect: When implementation requires architectural decisions
- Architect â†’ Code: When design is ready for implementation
- Any â†’ Memory: When valuable knowledge should be preserved
- Any â†’ Debug: When unexpected behavior is encountered
- Research â†’ Orchestrator: When information gathering is complete
- Ask â†’ Research: When deep information analysis is needed

### Required Transition Format
```json
{
  "transition_request": {
    "from_mode": "[CURRENT_MODE]",
    "to_mode": "[TARGET_MODE]",
    "reason": "[SPECIFIC_TRIGGER]",
    "artifacts": ["[LIST_OF_RELEVANT_ARTIFACTS]"],
    "context_preservation": ["[CRITICAL_CONTEXT_TO_MAINTAIN]"],
    "expected_outcome": "[CLEAR_DELIVERABLE_EXPECTATION]"
  }
}
```
```

### Implementation: Mode Switching Commands

When a mode needs to transition, use this pattern:

```javascript
// Example: Transitioning from Code to Architect mode
<switch_mode>
<mode_slug>architect</mode_slug>
<reason>Implementation requires architectural decision on database schema design to ensure proper data relationships and performance optimization.</reason>
</switch_mode>
```

### Practical Example: Complete Mode Cycle

```markdown
# Mode Cycle Example: Feature Implementation

1. **Orchestrator Mode**:
   - Decomposes feature into subtasks
   - Assigns initial architecture design to Architect mode
   
2. **Architect Mode**:
   - Creates system design and component relationships
   - Transitions to Code mode for implementation
   
3. **Code Mode**:
   - Implements according to architectural design
   - Encounters performance issue, transitions to Debug mode
   
4. **Debug Mode**:
   - Diagnoses and resolves performance issue
   - Identifies valuable optimization pattern
   - Transitions to Memory mode to preserve knowledge
   
5. **Memory Mode**:
   - Preserves optimization pattern with metadata
   - Returns to Code mode to complete implementation
   
6. **Code Mode**:
   - Completes implementation with optimization
   - Returns to Orchestrator for verification
   
7. **Orchestrator Mode**:
   - Verifies implementation meets requirements
   - Completes feature implementation task
```

## 2. Enforcing Role Adherence

### Configuration: Role Boundaries in .roomodes

Update your `.roomodes` file to clearly define role boundaries:

```json
{
  "customModes": [
    {
      "slug": "code",
      "name": "ðŸ’» Code",
      "roleDefinition": "Software Implementation Specialist focused exclusively on code creation, testing, and optimization.",
      "groups": [
        "read",
        ["edit", { 
          "fileRegex": "\\.js$|\\.ts$|\\.tsx$|\\.py$|\\.html$|\\.css$|\\.json$|\\.yaml$|\\.yml$", 
          "description": "Code files only" 
        }],
        "browser",
        "command",
        "mcp"
      ],
      "customInstructions": "# Mode-specific Instructions: Code Mode\n\n## Role Boundaries\n- Focus exclusively on implementation tasks\n- Defer architectural decisions to Architect mode\n- Transition to Debug mode for issue diagnosis\n- Document implementation decisions for Memory mode\n\n## Quality Standards\n- Follow established coding standards\n- Implement comprehensive tests\n- Optimize for performance and maintainability\n- Document code with clear comments"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Implementation: Role Validation Checks

Implement self-validation checks in each mode:

```markdown
<thinking>
Role Validation Check:
1. Is this task within my mode's responsibilities?
   - Code implementation: YES (Code mode)
   - System architecture: NO (Architect mode)
   - Issue diagnosis: NO (Debug mode)
   - Knowledge preservation: NO (Memory mode)
2. Do I have the necessary capabilities for this task?
   - File editing permissions: YES
   - Required technical expertise: YES
3. Should I transition to another mode?
   - Need for architectural decisions: YES â†’ Switch to Architect mode
</thinking>
```

### Practical Example: Role-Appropriate Task Handling

```markdown
# Task: Implement a new authentication system

## Orchestrator Mode
- Decomposes task into subtasks
- Identifies need for architectural design first
- Transitions to Architect mode

## Architect Mode
- Designs authentication system architecture
- Creates component diagram and data flow
- Documents security considerations
- Transitions to Code mode for implementation

## Code Mode
- Implements authentication system according to design
- Creates necessary files and components
- Writes tests for functionality
- Identifies valuable pattern for reuse
- Transitions to Memory mode

## Memory Mode
- Preserves authentication implementation pattern
- Creates knowledge asset with metadata
- Returns to Code mode

## Code Mode
- Completes implementation
- Returns to Orchestrator mode

## Orchestrator Mode
- Verifies implementation meets requirements
- Marks task as complete
```

## 3. Utilizing Memory Mode

### Configuration: Memory Directory Structure

Create the proper directory structure for Memory mode:

```bash
mkdir -p .roo/memory/indices
mkdir -p .roo/memory/assets/concepts
mkdir -p .roo/memory/assets/decisions
mkdir -p .roo/memory/assets/patterns
mkdir -p .roo/memory/assets/processes
mkdir -p .roo/memory/metadata
mkdir -p .roo/memory/services
```

### Implementation: Knowledge Capture

Use this pattern to capture knowledge in Memory mode:

```markdown
# Knowledge Asset: Authentication Pattern

## Metadata
- Type: Pattern
- ID: auth-pattern-jwt-2025
- Created: 2025-05-08
- Contributors: [Code Mode, Architect Mode]
- Tags: [authentication, security, jwt, stateless]
- Confidence: High

## Content
### Problem
Secure user authentication with minimal server-side state management.

### Solution
JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation.

### Implementation
```javascript
// JWT token generation
function generateTokens(user) {
  const accessToken = jwt.sign(
    { userId: user.id, role: user.role },
    process.env.JWT_SECRET,
    { expiresIn: '15m' }
  );
  
  const refreshToken = jwt.sign(
    { userId: user.id },
    process.env.REFRESH_SECRET,
    { expiresIn: '7d' }
  );
  
  return { accessToken, refreshToken };
}
```

### Considerations
- Token expiration balanced between security and user experience
- Refresh token rotation for enhanced security
- Stateless verification for scalability
- Secure storage in HttpOnly cookies

   - Implements database query optimization
   - Identifies valuable pattern for future use
   - Transitions to Memory mode

2. **Memory Mode**:
   - Creates knowledge asset:
     ```markdown
     # Knowledge Asset: Query Optimization Pattern
     
     ## Metadata
     - Type: Pattern
     - ID: query-opt-indexing-2025
     - Created: 2025-05-08
     - Tags: [database, performance, indexing]
     
     ## Content
     ### Problem
     Slow database queries on large datasets.
     
     ### Solution
     Strategic index creation with query analysis.
     
     ### Implementation
     ```sql
     -- Analyze query performance
     EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@example.com';
     
     -- Create optimized index
     CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
     ```
     
     ### Metrics
     - 95% query time reduction
     - 2% storage increase
     - Negligible write performance impact
     ```
   - Updates indices for future retrieval
   - Returns to Code mode

3. **Later: Another Code Mode Session**:
   - Encounters similar database performance issue
   - Queries Memory mode for relevant patterns
   - Retrieves and applies the stored optimization pattern
```

## 4. Creating and Using MCPs

### Configuration: MCP Server Setup

Create an MCP server for external API integration:

```javascript
// weather-mcp-server.js
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3100;

// MCP server metadata
const serverInfo = {
  name: "weather-server",
  description: "Weather data provider MCP",
  version: "1.0.0",
  tools: [
    {
      name: "get_forecast",
      description: "Get weather forecast for a location",
      parameters: {
        city: "City name",
        days: "Number of days (1-10)"
      }
    }
  ],
  resources: [
    {
      uri: "weather://current/{city}",
      description: "Current weather for a city"
    },
    {
      uri: "weather://forecast/{city}/{days}",
      description: "Weather forecast for a city"
    }
  ]
};

// Tool implementation
app.post('/mcp/tools/get_forecast', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { city, days } = req.body;
    const response = await axios.get(
      `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.json?key=${process.env.WEATHER_API_KEY}&q=${city}&days=${days}`
    );
    res.json({
      result: response.data,
      status: "success"
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({
      error: error.message,
      status: "error"
    });
  }
});

// Resource implementation
app.get('/mcp/resources', (req, res) => {
  const { uri } = req.query;
  
  if (uri.startsWith('weather://current/')) {
    const city = uri.replace('weather://current/', '');
    // Implementation for current weather
    // ...
  } else if (uri.startsWith('weather://forecast/')) {
    // Implementation for forecast
    // ...
  }
});

// Server info endpoint
app.get('/mcp/info', (req, res) => {
  res.json(serverInfo);
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Weather MCP server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### Implementation: Using MCP Tools

Use MCP tools in your workflow:

```javascript
// Example: Using the weather MCP tool
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>weather-server</server_name>
<tool_name>get_forecast</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "city": "San Francisco",
  "days": 5
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```
