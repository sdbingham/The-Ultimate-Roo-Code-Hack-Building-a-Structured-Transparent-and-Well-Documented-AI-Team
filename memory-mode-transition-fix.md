# Memory Mode Transition Fix

## Issue Description

When using the Roo Framework, it has been observed that the system correctly switches agents to Memory mode, but fails to switch them back out of Memory mode when the memory operations are complete. This creates a workflow disruption as the user must manually switch back to the appropriate mode.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the issue, I've identified the root cause:

1. The Memory mode's custom instructions in the `.roomodes` file are missing the **Mode Transition Protocol** section that is present in other modes' instructions.

2. Without this protocol, Memory mode doesn't have the guidance to properly implement the boomerang pattern, which requires it to transition back to the originating mode after completing its task.

3. The boomerang logic implementation exists in `roo-framework-package/lib/boomerang.js`, but Memory mode isn't properly utilizing it.

## Solution

Update the Memory mode's custom instructions in the `.roomodes` file to include the Mode Transition Protocol section. This will ensure that Memory mode properly transitions back to the originating mode after completing its task.

### Current Memory Mode Instructions

```markdown
# Mode-specific Custom Instructions: Memory Mode

## Knowledge Management Process

### 1. Acquisition Phase
- Identify valuable information for retention
- Extract key concepts, relationships, and metadata
- Convert implicit knowledge into explicit documentation
- Verify accuracy and completeness of captured information

### 2. Organization & Indexing
- Apply consistent taxonomies and categorization
- Create appropriate metadata and tagging
- Establish cross-references and relationships
- Generate searchable indices and retrieval structures
- Maintain versioning and change tracking
```

### Updated Memory Mode Instructions

```markdown
# Mode-specific Custom Instructions: Memory Mode

## Knowledge Management Process

### 1. Acquisition Phase
- Identify valuable information for retention
- Extract key concepts, relationships, and metadata
- Convert implicit knowledge into explicit documentation
- Verify accuracy and completeness of captured information

### 2. Organization & Indexing
- Apply consistent taxonomies and categorization
- Create appropriate metadata and tagging
- Establish cross-references and relationships
- Generate searchable indices and retrieval structures
- Maintain versioning and change tracking

## Mode Transition Protocol

### Transition Triggers
- To Orchestrator: When knowledge preservation is complete
- To Architect: When architectural knowledge is needed
- To Code: When implementation knowledge is needed
- To Debug: When diagnostic knowledge is needed
- To Research: When research knowledge is needed
- To Ask: When knowledge retrieval clarification is needed

### Pre-Transition Checklist
- Have I properly categorized and indexed the knowledge?
- Have I established appropriate metadata and relationships?
- Have I created searchable indices for retrieval?
- Have I preserved context and provenance information?
- Have I updated relevant knowledge indices?

### Handoff Documentation
When transitioning to another mode, include:
1. Knowledge assets created or updated
2. Categorization and indexing applied
3. Relationships established with existing knowledge
4. Retrieval patterns for accessing the knowledge
5. Recommendations for knowledge application

### Transition Command Format
```
<switch_mode>
<mode_slug>originating_mode</mode_slug>
<reason>Knowledge preservation is complete. Returning to continue the main task.</reason>
</switch_mode>
```

### Boomerang Implementation
- Always record the originating mode when receiving a task
- After completing knowledge preservation tasks, automatically transition back to the originating mode
- Use the following pattern to implement the boomerang return:
  1. Verify task completion with the pre-transition checklist
  2. Document the knowledge assets created or updated
  3. Use the switch_mode command to return to the originating mode
  4. Include a clear reason for the transition
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Open the `.roomodes` file in the project root directory.

2. Locate the Memory mode section (around line 69).

3. Update the `customInstructions` field for the Memory mode with the updated instructions provided above.

4. Save the file.

## Verification

After implementing this fix, verify that Memory mode correctly transitions back to the originating mode by:

1. Starting in Orchestrator mode
2. Transitioning to Memory mode for a knowledge preservation task
3. Completing the task in Memory mode
4. Confirming that the system automatically transitions back to Orchestrator mode

## Additional Considerations

1. **Task Context Preservation**: Ensure that when transitioning to Memory mode, the task context includes the originating mode so that Memory mode knows where to return.

2. **Completion Verification**: Consider adding a verification step in Memory mode to confirm that its task is actually complete before transitioning back.

3. **Error Handling**: Add error handling to ensure that if there's an issue with the transition, it's properly logged and the user is notified.

4. **Documentation**: Update the Memory mode documentation to reflect this change and explain the boomerang pattern to users.

This fix ensures that Memory mode properly follows the boomerang pattern, transitioning back to the originating mode after completing its task, which will improve the overall workflow and user experience.
